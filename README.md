This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) cos I'm fucking lazy. Nevertheless, in case I forget:

`npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`npm test` to run tests

`npm run build` - hopefully at some point in the future. [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) may help.

# Knots
> learn how to tie about 2 climbing knots as that is all you will ever need!

## Stack
- React, react-router, react-router-dom
- Styled Components
- Typescript

## Figma Prototype
[can be found here](https://www.figma.com/proto/GPZh3JwWvqXSRKI0Lc4kqSa9)


## TODO
1. redo detailed figure 8 svg:
-  Orange rope to be longer (includes half of mint part)
-  Other half of mint part attached to green part
-  left buckle to have right segment on top
-  right buckle to have left segment on bottom

2. setup to show simple knot initially, then detailed on click

3. in-knot routing - is this possible?

4. once at a stable point, introduce typescript

5. dressing the knot and shape morphing:
