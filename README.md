This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) cos I'm fucking lazy. Nevertheless, in case I forget:

`npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`npm test` to run tests

`npm run build` - hopefully at some point in the future. [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) may help.
