# Logic / steps for fig8

1. /figure-8 (start)
- show fully dressed knot, ties in harness
- 100% scale, no rotate or morph

2. /figure-8/step-1
- start zoomed and moved (scale and transform)
- animate loose knot (stroke dashoffset)
- mention length of tail to leave (fade out)

3. /figure-8/step-2
- transform upward to show harness loops
- animate loose rope going through harness loops (fade out)
- pull knot tight to harness (basic morph)
