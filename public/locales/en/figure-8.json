  "title": "Figure 8",
  "overview": {
    "paragraph": "The figure 8 knot is the most popular knot for tying the rope to your harness when climbing. The figure 8 is strong, retaining 75 to 80% of the rope’s strength, and is easy to tie. Although it doesn’t require a backup (or stopper) knot, most people will combine it with one.",
    "uses": [
      "Tying in to a climbing rope",
      "Building belay anchors"
    ],
    "pros": [
      "A secure and strong knot, slips very little",
      "Easy to see if it is tied wrong"
    ],
    "cons": [
      "Can be hard to untie if fallen on"
    ]
  },
  "steps": {
    "1": "Form the figure 8 knot that you will re-weave / tie in to, making sure it is tied at least one arm’s length into your climbing rope.",
    "2": "Pass the end of your rope through both tie-in points on your harness, pulling the knot close to your harness.",
    "3": "Feed the tail end of the rope back through the figure 8 knot that you formed in step 1, making sure that both strands run parallel to each other, and are neat and tight.",
    "4": "Form a stopper knot with the tail end by coiling the tail end back towards the figure 8 knot. Make at least two coils, positioning the last coil close to the figure 8.",
    "5": "Complete the stopper knot by feeding the tail end up through the coils, and away from the figure 8. Tighten the stopper knot by pushing the coils down, and pulling the tail end up."
